Hey everyone,

Here is an example Flash AS3 project that shows you how to use the VimeoPlayer.as class that we have provided for you within an example project. This example assumes that you have some prior Action Script coding experience and familiarity with object oriented development.

With that said, all the examples that you need are here, but this is definitely targeted toward users with intermediate knowledge of Flash and Action Script development.

If you run into any issues using the VimeoPlayer class in your project, please let us know the Vimeo API forums (http://vimeo.com/forum:api).

Thanks.

Love,
Vimeo
